     * @brief Initializes the crash reporting system.
     *
     * This function sets up crash reporting for the emulator. It should be called
     * only once at program startup. This function attempts to start the
     * out-of-process Crashpad handler. If the handler is successfully started,
     * crashes will be recorded in a local database and can be uploaded later. If
     * the Crashpad handler cannot be started, crash reporting will be disabled, and
     * a warning will be logged.
     *
     * Internally, this function utilizes the `CrashpadClient::StartHandler()`
     * method to establish communication with the Crashpad handler and configure
     * exception handling. Refer to the documentation of `StartHandler()` for
     * platform-specific details on how the handler is started and how exception
     * ports or signal handlers are configured.
     *
     * Crash reporting is controlled by the `ANDROID_EMU_ENABLE_CRASH_REPORTING`
     * environment variable. If this variable is not set or is set to "0", crash
     * reporting will be disabled.
     *
     * @param argc The number of command line arguments. These are used to populate
     *     the crash report if a crash occurs.
     * @param argv An array of command line arguments. These are used to populate
     *     the crash report if a crash occurs.
     * @return True if crash reporting was successfully initialized, false otherwise.
     *
     * @note If the Crashpad handler cannot be found, crash reporting will be
     *     disabled. The handler location can be influenced by setting the
     *     `AEMU_CRASHPAD_HANDLER` environment variable.
     *
     * @note The crash report database is stored in a platform-specific temporary
     *     directory by default, and its name is based on the emulator version.
     *     The location can be overridden by setting the
     *     `ANDROID_EMU_CRASH_REPORTING_DATABASE` environment variable.
     *
     * @note On macOS every child process will be handled by this reporter, on every
     *     other platform a reporter will need to be registered by the client.
