/**
 * @brief The guest keyboard behind QEMU's keyboard state, as a `KeyboardSink`.
 *
 * Each key is sent to QEMU before the call returns, so keys and touches
 * written in order on the QEMU loop reach the guest in that order. Text is
 * translated as `IKeyEventSender` translates it: a press and release per ASCII
 * character, with modifiers as needed.
 *
 * ### Thread Safety:
 * `WriteKey()` and `TypeText()` run only on the QEMU loop.
 *
 * ### Ownership:
 * Owns its QEMU keyboard state. Destroy the sink on the QEMU loop, or after
 * the loop has stopped, so the state is never freed while QEMU uses it.
