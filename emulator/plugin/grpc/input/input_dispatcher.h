/**
 * @brief The `IInputDispatcher` of the emulator: an actor on the QEMU event loop.
 *
 * Sessions post operations, which the loop applies in the order they were
 * posted. The loop stamps and sequences each activity into an outbox; a
 * delivery thread fires them, so observer work stays off the loop.
 *
 * ### Invariants:
 * - The `ContactTable` matches the contacts written to each active device,
 *   except briefly between a device active-generation transition and the
 *   queued `ResyncDevices()` task (or pre-operation check) that clears them.
 * - Each device receives at most one report per operation (or two when palm
 *   cancelling contacts), written whole.
 * - A key is in `key_holders_`, with a non-empty set of open sessions, iff the
 *   last write of that key to the keyboard was a press.
 * - `outbox_` holds the undelivered activities in sequence order, ending just
 *   before `next_sequence_`.
 * - Each operation in `pending_` is posted, or being posted, and hasn't run,
 *   and its `done` is called once: by its loop task or by `Shutdown()`,
 *   whichever removes it from `pending_`. `in_flight_` counts each session's
 *   operations in `pending_`, never more than the cap, and holds no zero.
 *
 * ### Thread Safety:
 * Public methods are thread-safe and post to the loop; all other state is
 * touched only on the loop, except the pending operations, guarded by
 * `pending_mutex_`, and the outbox, guarded by `outbox_mutex_`. Lock order:
 * both are leaves; nothing holds both, and nothing holds either while calling
 * `done`, writing to a sink, or firing activity.
 *
 * ### Ownership:
 * `loop`, `devices`, `keyboard`, and `clock` must outlive `Shutdown()` and any
 * in-flight loop tasks; once `Shutdown()` returns and the loop has stopped (or
 * drained all posted tasks), the dispatcher never accesses them, so clients
 * may safely hold a stopped dispatcher past its owner. Destruction calls
 * `Shutdown()`.
