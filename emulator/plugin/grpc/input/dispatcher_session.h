/**
 * @brief One input client's session with the input dispatcher: the client's
 * identity (the options its session was opened with) and the route its v2 input
 * events take to the guest.
 *
 * Constructing it opens the session; destroying it closes the session, which
 * releases only this client's contacts and keys.
 *
 * ### Thread Safety:
 * `Dispatch()` may be called from any thread, but the dispatcher applies one
 * client's events in the order they were dispatched, so a client should
 * dispatch from one thread to keep its order.
 *
 * ### Ownership:
 * Shares ownership of the dispatcher, so a session held by a long-lived
 * transport (e.g., a WebRTC channel) can safely close after the dispatcher's
 * owner has shut the dispatcher down and torn down its loop and sinks. Once
 * `Shutdown()` has run, events complete with `UNAVAILABLE` and closing is a
 * no-op without touching loop-only state.
