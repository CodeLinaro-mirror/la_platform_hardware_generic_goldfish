/**
 * @brief The guest touch devices of the emulator's displays.
 *
 * Each display has its own virtio input device, identified by the display's ID.
 * `Resolve()` maps a requested display to the display that receives its
 * touches, applying the foldable remap of display 0 to 1. `Find()` returns the
 * sink that writes reports to a display's device synchronously and reports
 * whether its guest driver is active.
 *
 * ### Thread Safety:
 * Called only on the QEMU event loop, like `TouchDevices`.
 *
 * ### Ownership:
 * `multi_display` must outlive this object. Sinks are owned by this object and
 * cached per device, so a pointer returned by `Find()` stays valid for this
 * object's lifetime, even after its display is removed. A sink holds only a
 * weak reference to its display, which `Find()` rebinds to the display that
 * currently has the device's ID; a sink whose display is gone is inactive and
 * writes nothing.
