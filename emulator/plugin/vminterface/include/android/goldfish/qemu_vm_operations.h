/**
 * @brief Creates the VmOperations implementation that controls the QEMU VM.
 *
 * The instance registers QEMU run-state and snapshot-progress handlers when
 * constructed and unregisters them when destroyed, both under the VM lock.
 * Create it once the VM lock is usable (for example while devices are realized)
 * and keep it alive for as long as consumers hold references to it.
 *
 * Mutating and snapshot operations are dispatched synchronously to `qemu_loop`
 * via `PostAndWait`. They are expected to be called from external threads
 * (such as gRPC server or worker threads) and will fatally abort if called
 * from either `event_loop` or `qemu_loop`. Read-only queries (`IsRunning`,
 * `GetRunState`, `GetConfiguration`, `GetSnapshotProgress`) execute directly
 * without posting to `qemu_loop` and may be called from any thread.
 *
 * Only the QEMU calls themselves (`save_snapshot`, `load_snapshot`,
 * `delete_snapshot`, `bdrv_snapshot_list`, `vm_stop`) run on `qemu_loop`; the
 * `SnapshotStore` file system work happens on the calling thread before and
 * after, so no extra I/O is done under the BQL.
 *
 * @param event_loop The loop that runs the `RunStateEvents()` and
 *        `SnapshotEvents()` callbacks. Must be distinct from `qemu_loop` and
 *        outlive the returned instance.
 * @param qemu_loop The QEMU main event loop used to execute VM operations. Must
 *        outlive the returned instance.
 * @param snapshot_config Snapshot store and policy, see `QemuSnapshotConfig`.
 *        `store` must not be null.
 * @param hang_detector Hang detector with which the snapshot progress watchdog
 *        predicate is registered while a snapshot save or load is in flight,
 *        including the ones QEMU runs without VmOperations (the exit-time
 *        -savevm, HMP savevm/loadvm). Must not be null and must outlive the
 *        returned instance.
 * @param clock Clock source used for snapshot progress throttling. Must outlive
 *        the returned instance. Defaults to `::android::base::IClock::Get()`.
 * @return The QEMU-backed VmOperations.
